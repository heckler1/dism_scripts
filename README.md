The ApplyImage script restores DISM images to the main hard drive. It prepares the hard drive with the appropriate partitions: an EFI partition, an MSR partition, an OS partition and a recovery partition. It then restores the specific .wim files to the appropriate partitions, and prepares the EFI bootloader on the new disk.

The CreateImage script mounts the EFI partition and then captures DISM images of the EFI partition and the main OS partition.
